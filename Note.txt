A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets.
Code Splitting allows for loading parts of the application on demand.
Through "loaders", modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff.

The 2 Main things Webpack does:
- It bundles our code/assets together
- It manages dependencies

-----------------------------------

test: /\.css$/,
$ means it ends
\ is for escape, it needs the escape character before .

-------------------------------------

css-loader: convert css into js code.
            Loads CSS file with resolved imports and returns CSS code
e.g. body {
         background: purple;
     }
     to
     exports.push([module.i, "body {\r\n    background: purple;\r\n}\r\n", ""]);


style-load: take a js script (contains the css) and inject into the DOM.
            Add exports of a module as style to DOM
            Automatically injects styles into the DOM using multiple <style></style>. It is default behaviour.

use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
            The loading is actually in reverse order. The above means css-loader will be used first and it will out put the js.
            And then the js will be injected as a input of the style-loader.
            We now should be able to see the background is purple.
            And if you go to chrome developer tool -> Element -> <head>, you will see
            <style>body {
                background: purple;
            }
            </style>

-----------------------------------------

filename: "main.[contentHash].js",
    Add [contentHash] is to prevent cashing (Cache Busting and Plugins).
    The [contentHash] is calculated against the content of the files bundled as part of webpack. JS, SCSS files. etc
    Any of these files changes will cause a new hash key generated.

HtmlWebpackPlugin - Easily create HTML files to serve your bundles
    This is for generate the main.xxx.js file and inject it as a script tab in index.html
