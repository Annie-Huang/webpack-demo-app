=========================================================

A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets.
Code Splitting allows for loading parts of the application on demand.
Through "loaders", modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff.

The 2 Main things Webpack does:
- It bundles our code/assets together
- It manages dependencies


test: /\.css$/,
$ means it ends
\ is for escape, it needs the escape character before .
