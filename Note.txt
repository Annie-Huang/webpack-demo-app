=========================================================

A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets.
Code Splitting allows for loading parts of the application on demand.
Through "loaders", modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff.

The 2 Main things Webpack does:
- It bundles our code/assets together
- It manages dependencies

==========================================================

C:\react\webpack-demo-app>npm init -y
C:\react\webpack-demo-app>npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
C:\react\webpack-demo-app>npm run start

Error of:
ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in 'C:\react\webpack-demo-app'
>> This is be default in node application, they expect you to have a ./src/index.js as a default entry file.

Added ./src/index.js and run "npm run start", and we get:
Entrypoint main = main.js
>> .dist/main.js is created
